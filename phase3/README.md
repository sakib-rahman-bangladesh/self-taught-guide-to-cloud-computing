# Phase 3: Cloud Platform

This phase is the longest and for good reason.

AWS, Azure, GCP, the million dollar question. We would rule out GCP because there's already so much content, community, and jobs for AWS and Azure, which are essential when you're getting started. AWS or Azure? You can't go wrong with either. Regardless of which one you choose, the fundamentals are the same and our advice is the same.

Whichever cloud you pick, make sure you create an account and setup some budgets and alerts so you don't wake up to surprises on your bill. [Here](https://youtu.be/FZD0s7KE83Y) is how to do it in the Azure portal, and here [AWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvz0cphjHjg).

## A note on paid cloud learning platforms

There are platforms out there like [A Cloud Guru](https://acloudguru.com) and [CloudAcademy](https://cloudacademy.com) that you can pay for a monthly or yearly subscription and gain access to content and lab environments for your learning. These do help you avoid spending your own money in your own AWS and Azure accounts, which when you're getting started is a good thing. Ultimately, if you sign up for one, it's up to you. I had a subscription to A Cloud Guru and Linux Academy when I was getting started, my work paid for it though, maybe this is a perk your work can pay for too.

## Take a certification

I personally like cloud certifications, they give you a nice outline to follow in terms of learning. However I don't think you need to have every single certification out there. One or two, plus the Linux, networking, programming, knowledge is plenty and already quite impressive when you're starting off.

As you grow and want to specialize, certifications are great for up-skilling! 

## Certifications you might want to look into

You have two options here:

- Entry level certification: Like the [AWS Certified cloud practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) or the [Azure Fundamentals AZ-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/exams/az-900).
- Skip the entry level and go for an associate level: AWS has [three](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/) associate level certifications and Azure has I believe [four now](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/browse/?resource_type=certification&products=azure&terms=associate).

You can skip the entry level one and take more time studying for the associate, or take them both. Up to you. All certifications have an outline available and you can leverage them to decide if you want to take them.

For the associate level AWS, I would go with any of them, I've heard the [SysOps](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/) one is the hardest. Personally I have the [AWS certified developer associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/) (it expired, but hey I still studied for it so I'm counting it!) it was a fun certification to study for. For Azure I would go for the [AZ-104](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/azure-administrator/) or [AZ-204](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/azure-developer/). The other associate level ones are a little more specificized. You can of course take them later on :)

## How to approach learning cloud computing

Regardless of which learning material you choose, it'll have some sort of demo/hands-on aspect to it. Do it. Don't just watch/read. This isn't a Netflix show you're consuming, this is learning time. If the instructor is doing something on screen, watch it, and then try it on your own.

When you are first getting started with cloud, you'll be doing everything via the UI, and that is fine for getting started, however once you're in a job, you'll be using a CLI to manage your environments. My advice here is, for every exercise you do via the UI, look up the CLI command and do it that way too. By now you should be familiar with using a command line.

Eventually you'll learn these commands and it'll become easier to remember which one to use, but this is also a great time to introduce yourself to the official documentation, [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html) and [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/?product=featured)

If there is something you don't understand about a service or command, your go to should be the documentation. After that you can look up articles, tutorials, etc.

## Things you should be familiar with at the end of this phase

- An understanding of best practices for cloud infrastructure (reliability, performance efficiency, security, etc.)
- How to grant and revoke access and permissions to users and applications in your cloud of choice.
- How to setup billing alerts/alarms, budgets, and how to use the billing tools of your cloud platform of choice.
- How to use the object storage service of your cloud of choice and and overall understanding of other storage options that cloud offers.
- How to deploy scalable virtual machines in the service of you cloud of choice and and overall understanding of other compute services that cloud offers.
- How networking works for the virtual machine service of your cloud of choice (Vnets/VPCs, subnets, route tables, public and private IP addresses, vpns, gateways, etc.)
- How to create a simple HTTP API with the serverless offering of your cloud of choice and an overall understanding of what that offering is capable of doing.
- Deploy 2 VNets (VPCs) and a virtual machine in each one. The virtual machines must not have a public IP and must not be accessible via the internet. You must be able to ssh into one of them and  and ping the other from it.
- How to use the CLI of your cloud of choice to accomplish all of the above.
